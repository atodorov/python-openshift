Use the official package from Red Hat:
https://github.com/openshift/python-interface


This is a Python interface to Red Hat's OpenShift cloud platform.

This is based on the OpenShift API docs:
http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/OpenShift_Express/1.0/html/API_Guide/index.html

and on the Ruby code found in the rhc package.

**NOTE**: There is newer REST API for OpenShift and this package was
based on the older API. It will probably not work at all now.
